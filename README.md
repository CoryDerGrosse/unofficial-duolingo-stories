# Unofficial Duolingo Stories
This project brings the official Duolingo Stories to new languages, translated by a community efford.

It is not an offocial product of Duolingo, nor is there any plan to integrate it into their platform or app.

It is hosted at www.duostories.org and reproduces the story experience from the official Duolingo stories.

The project consits basically of two front end apps, the stories-app and the editor-app. The stories-app is the part that 
the learners will see (hosted on www.duostories.org) and the editor-app is the part that the contributors will see to 
translate and review stories.
